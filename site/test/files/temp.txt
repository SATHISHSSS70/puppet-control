Manage users. This type is mostly built to manage system users, so it is lacking some features useful for managing normal users.

This resource type uses the prescribed native tools for creating groups and generally uses POSIX APIs for retrieving information about them. It does not directly modify /etc/passwd or anything.

Autorequires: If Puppet is managing the user’s primary group (as provided in the gid attribute), the user resource will autorequire that group. If Puppet is managing any role accounts corresponding to the user’s roles, the user resource will autorequire those role accounts.
